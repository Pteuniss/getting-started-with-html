<h1>Notes about the internet</h1>
<h2>How the web works</h2>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers working together. When someone uses a 
browser and opens up a webpage, the computer sends a <i>http request</i> to a 
<i>server</i>. Servers are big computers on which data is stored. There are millions of servers
around the world. After the request is recognized, it sends the information to the
<i>webbrowser</i> and the <em><b>browser</em></b> shows the user the 
requested information on his or her screen.
</p>

<h2> HTML</h2>
<p>HTML stands for <em><b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage</em>. These texts
are documents on the internet and they form the most content on the web. 
Beside HTML you have pictures, video and many more things!
HTML documents contain text, which describe what the user sees.
</p>

<h3> HTML Tags and Element </h3>
<p>HTML is made up of elements. There are a lot of tags to form elements and you do not 
need to learn them by head, mainly because you will learn them automatically
by looking them up and applying them. It's really easy to find all the tags.
I found mine on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">this website</a>.
Beside following this course, use the internet to learn more if you don't understand and
don't go asking inmediatly. The easy way out isnt always the most learnful!
</p>

<h3> Void Tags </h3>
<p> Void tags are tags that <b>don't need</b> a closure tag.
These are for example:<br>
<xmp>the <br> text
the <img> text</xmp><br>
</p>

<h3> How the standard HTML document is build up</h3>
</p><xmp> <!doctype html> 
  <html>
  <head> (head meta data part)
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body></body>
    <b>content</b>
</xmp>
</p>
